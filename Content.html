    <div class="content">
        <h2>The nature and significance of New Zealand's bi-cultural society</h2>
        <p>For many years following the arrival of Europeans, New Zealand's society evolved into a distinct bicultural
            entity. This unique identity is a fusion of Māori and European cultures, both playing integral roles in
            shaping
            the nation's identity and principles. The importance lies in recognizing and commemorating these diverse
            cultural influences, which not only enrich New Zealand's heritage but also promote unity and integration
            within
            society.</p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph -->
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Treaty of Waitangi – history and significance</h2>
        <p>The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between the British Crown and Māori chiefs, holds profound
            significance in
            New Zealand's historical narrative. Serving as a cornerstone document, it delineates the principles of
            partnership, protection, and participation, setting the groundwork for the interaction between Māori and the
            government. Its importance lies in its acknowledgment of Māori entitlements, encompassing land tenure and
            the
            safeguarding of cultural heritage.</p>

    <!-- Third Paragraph -->
    <div class="content">
        <h2>How New Zealand's bi-cultural society relates to the IT industry</h2>
        <p>The bi-cultural nature of New Zealand's society permeates various sectors, including the IT industry. In the
            IT
            sector, initiatives are undertaken to incorporate Māori perspectives and values into technological
            developments.
            This includes indigenous knowledge systems, language preservation efforts, and culturally sensitive design
            practices.
